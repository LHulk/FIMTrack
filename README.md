FIMTrack needs 

- Qt (GUI)
- OpenCV (Computer Vision Library)

FIMTrack is a larval tracking program to acquire locomotion trajectories 
and conformation information of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. It is 
optimized for FIM images. FIM is an acronym for FTIR-based Imaging Method, 
whereby FTIR is the short form for Frustrated Total Internal Reflection.
