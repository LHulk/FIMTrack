FIMTrack needs 

- [Qt] (https://www.qt.io/) for the UI
- [OpenCV] (http://opencv.org/) as a Computer Vision Library
- [QCustomPlot] (http://www.qcustomplot.com/) for plotting results

To compile FIMTrack from source OpenCV 2.4.11 and Qt 5.5.1 are required. 
Additionally after downloading QCustomPlot place the header and source 
files in the "Utility" folder of FIMTrack. 

### What is this repository for?

FIMTrack is a larval tracking program to acquire locomotion trajectories 
and conformation information of Drosophila melanogaster larvae. It is 
optimized for FIM images. FIM is an acronym for FTIR-based Imaging Method, 
whereby FTIR is the short form for Frustrated Total Internal Reflection.
